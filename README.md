# Project Description: Currency Converter

The Currency Converter displays the current exchange rates for USD and EUR in
relation to UAH. You can also perform conversions in both directions between the
offered currencies: UAH, USD, EUR.

All exchange rate information is provided by the resource
https://apilayer.com/.In addition, this resource has a limited number of
requests per month (no more than 250). If the application displays a 429 error
on the screen (or in the console), it means that the number of requests to this
API has been exceeded this month. Please contact the owner of this repository to
change the access key.

Please note that the resource displays the bank exchange rate for today and it
may differ from the exchange rate at currency exchange points. To find out the
exchange rate at currency exchange points, you can refer to
https://minfin.com.ua/.

To initialize and locally run the project, follow these steps:

1. npm i
2. npm start
